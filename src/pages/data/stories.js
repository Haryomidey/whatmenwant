                <h2>I Stopped Chasing Peace Outside</h2>
                <p><strong>By Tunde — Lagos (Lekki)</strong></p>

                <p>I used to think peace was something you buy — a new car, a bigger apartment, maybe a holiday. Every time I made more money, I told myself, “Now I'll finally rest.” But the peace never stayed.</p>

                <p>I was working in a tech startup in Lekki, chasing deadlines, chasing validation. I couldn't remember the last time I ate without checking my phone. Then one Sunday in June, I took a slow walk to the beach. I didn't plan it — I just left my phone at home and walked.</p>

                <p>There were small stalls selling suya, kids playing football on the sand, and a man whistling a tune I didn't know. I sat there, barefoot, and for the first time in a long time, I didn't want to be anywhere else. No emails, no traffic, no expectations. Just the sound of waves and the smell of salt.</p>

                <p>I realized I had been running from silence — but that silence was what I needed. My dad used to tell me, “Tunde, peace is not where you go, it's what you carry.” I didn't understand it back then. That day, it finally made sense.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Peace didn't come when I achieved more. It came when I stopped chasing it outside myself.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>I made small changes after that. I started saying no to unnecessary overtime. I walked to the market instead of driving. I began to pray, not to ask for more, but to give thanks. The peace came slowly, but it stayed longer this time.</p>

                <p>Now when people ask me how I found peace, I tell them: it's not hiding in success, or money, or even love. It's in how quiet your heart feels when everything else is loud.</p>

                <h2>Why I Walked Away</h2>
                <p><strong>By Emeka — Enugu</strong></p>

                <p>For a long time, I thought staying meant strength. I thought leaving meant failure. But I was wrong.</p>

                <p>I was in a relationship for four years. At first, everything was fine — laughter, plans, promises. But slowly, it became one-sided. I gave my time, my peace, my attention, but it was never enough. I tried to fix things, even when I was the only one trying.</p>

                <p>There were nights I couldn't sleep, wondering what I did wrong. I stopped hanging out with my friends because I didn't want to talk about it. My mother used to say, “Love is not supposed to drain you,” but I told myself I could handle it.</p>

                <p>Then one morning, during the rainy season, I took a ride back to my father's old house in Enugu. I sat outside, watching the rain hit the zinc roof, and realized I was tired — not just physically, but deep in my spirit. I whispered to myself, “You can't keep saving someone who doesn't want to be saved.”</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Walking away wasn't weakness. It was me choosing myself for once.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>I told her I needed space. She cried, called, begged — but my decision was made. I wasn't angry; I was just done. That night I slept for the first time in months. The kind of sleep that comes when your mind finally lets go.</p>

                <p>It took time to heal. Friends didn't understand at first. My mum told me she was proud I finally put myself first. I focused on my work, reconnected with old friends, and found happiness again — quiet, gentle happiness.</p>

                <p>Sometimes people think staying is love. But sometimes, love is knowing when to leave — even when it hurts.</p>

                <h2>The Day I Opened Up</h2>
                <p><strong>By Musa — Kaduna</strong></p>

                <p>I was raised to be tough. “Men don't cry,” my uncle used to say. So when things got hard, I kept it all inside. Even when I lost my job, I smiled and said, “I'm fine.” But I wasn't fine.</p>

                <p>Months passed. I couldn't find work. I was behind on rent. Every day felt heavier than the last. One night, I sat alone on my bed, staring at the ceiling, and I just broke down. I picked up my phone and called my friend Kabir. I didn't even know why — I just needed someone to hear me.</p>

                <p>He told me to come over. When I got there, we sat outside his house, under the yellow bulb by the door. I tried to joke, but halfway through I started crying. Real, ugly crying. I thought he would laugh, or pity me, or tell me to man up.</p>

                <p>But he didn't. He just listened. When I finished, he told me about his own struggles — how he almost gave up last year but found a way through. For the first time, I didn't feel small. I felt understood.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “That night I learned that strength isn't silence. Strength is honesty.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Since that day, I talk more. I still have pride, but not the kind that kills you slowly. I joined a small men's group in Kaduna; we meet once a month and talk about life. No judgment, no ego — just real talk.</p>

                <p>I used to think crying made a man weak. Now I know — pretending is what breaks you.</p>
