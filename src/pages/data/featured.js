                <h2>Peace</h2>
                <p><strong>By Chijioke — Abuja</strong></p>

                <p>Peace is not just quiet. It's that feeling when your mind is not fighting itself. I didn't understand that until last year when I almost broke down from too much hustle.</p>

                <p>I was working two jobs, sending money home, trying to prove I was doing well. Every night, I came back tired but couldn't sleep. My head was full. Then one day, my mum called and said, “My son, when last did you rest?” I laughed it off, but that question stayed in my head.</p>

                <p>I started doing small things differently — turning off my phone at night, walking to the junction instead of taking okada, sitting outside to feel evening breeze. It sounds small, but that's where peace started to come back.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Peace doesn't mean your life is perfect. It just means your heart is quiet enough to keep going.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Now, I don't chase arguments anymore. I don't respond to everything online. I pick my peace over proving my point. The world is loud already — I just choose not to add to the noise.</p>

                <p>So when people ask what men want, I say this: peace. Real peace. The kind that stays even when life is not smooth.</p>

                <h2>Loyal Love</h2>
                <p><strong>By Seyi — Ibadan</strong></p>

                <p>I used to think love was about grand things — gifts, surprises, words. But as I got older, I realized loyalty is what holds everything together. The quiet kind of love that doesn't leave when things get rough.</p>

                <p>There was a time my business crashed. People who used to call me “boss” stopped picking my calls. The only person who stayed was my girlfriend. She didn't have much, but she was there — cooking, checking on me, encouraging me to start again. That loyalty made me see love differently.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Love that stays when life gets hard is louder than a thousand sweet words.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Now when I talk to younger guys, I tell them: stop chasing who excites you for a moment. Find who gives you peace consistently. A woman who listens, prays with you, and stands beside you when you're not at your best — that's love that grows roots.</p>

                <p>Real men want loyal love — not perfect love, just real and steady. The kind that chooses you every day, even when it's not easy.</p>

                <h2>Respect</h2>
                <p><strong>By Ayo — Port Harcourt</strong></p>

                <p>Every man has that silent thing inside him that reacts to respect. It's not pride — it's how we're built. I grew up watching my father. He didn't have much, but the way my mum spoke to him made him walk taller. That taught me something early.</p>

                <p>Years later, I got into a relationship where every small issue turned into insult. “You're useless,” “You don't think,” “You're not doing enough.” It broke something in me. I started doubting myself at work, even when my boss was praising me. That's how deep disrespect cuts.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Men don't need worship. They just need to be spoken to like they matter.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>I'm not perfect either. I've learned that respect goes both ways. I listen more now, I say sorry when I'm wrong. But I'll tell you this — a man who feels respected will give you everything he has and more.</p>

                <p>Respect isn't about bowing or silence. It's about tone, timing, and truth. You can correct a man without tearing him down. Once a man feels respected, love and peace follow naturally.</p>

                <p>That's what most men want — not control, not fear, just mutual respect.</p>
